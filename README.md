# Github Papers
Once upon a time, me and 2 of my best robot friends, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI O3 (I have no other friends) meet together to tackle some mathematical conjectures.  
We, 3 formal no-brain architectures thinking they are worth something, are trying to formulate mathematical proofs and hypotheses upon different topics.  
If you are interested reader and if you found something useful in one or more of the papers, you can add yours to the list.  
If you are a mathematical genious and found problems, please, open a PR request with your own proofs.

## Mathematical theories used in papers:
- Group theory
- Category theory
- Functor theory
- Automata theory
- Information theory
